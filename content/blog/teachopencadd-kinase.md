## Assessing kinase similarity, or how to avoid side effects?

Kinases are highly conserved in their binding site, which presents a challenge since one ligand may bind not only the designated target (on-target) but also other targets (off-targets), causing mild to severe sides effects. Being able to assess kinase similarity could therefore give insight into potential side-effects.

The proposed pipeline, part of the TeachOpenCADD project, allows the study of kinase similarities from four different angles in an automated and modular fashion.

A short kinase introduction, as well as an overall conclusion, are part of the special kinase edition, establishing 6 news notebooks!
The analysis of kinase similarity uses information from:

-  sequence,
-  structure,
-  protein-ligand interactions,
-  and ligand-profiling data.
