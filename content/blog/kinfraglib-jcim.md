Our KinFragLib project is now published in the _Journal of Chemical Modeling 
and Information_: 
"KinFragLib: Exploring the Kinase Inhibitor Space Using Subpocket-Focused 
Fragmentation and Recombination" 
([DOI: 10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00839](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00839)).

Kinases are one of the most studied drug targets, resulting in an amount of 
available data too large to be analyzed manually. In the _KinFragLib_ project, 
a precise cartography of the ATP-binding site guides the fragmentation of 
cocrystallized kinase ligands by subpockets.
The resulting kinase-focused fragment library allows the analysis of the 
chemical space by subpocket and is a rich source of inspiration for building 
novel kinase inhibitors.

Subpocket-guided recombination of a divers subset of fragments generated
a combinatorial library of over 6 million molecules with over 99.99% of novel 
chemical matter (compared to ChEMBL 25). 
The rare exceptions of known compounds include predominately known 
kinase inhibitors. These results clearly highlight the enormous potential of 
this fragment library for the design of novel kinase inhibitors.
