Are you tired of hearing that deep learning needs more data and that physico-chemical data sets are still scarce? Check out our latest publication [Kimber, 2021](/publications/#kimber_ailsci_2021) for some augmentation strategies you can apply to improve your predictions when training deep neural networks using SMILES.

You can even make predictions for novel compounds using the command-line interface. The code is open-source and available on GitHub at https://github.com/volkamerlab/maxsmi.
