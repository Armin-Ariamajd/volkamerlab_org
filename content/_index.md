        <p>In silico toxicology and structural bioinformatics</p>
    </header>

At Volkamer Lab, we develop methods at the interface between structural bioinformatics and cheminformatics, mostly applied in the context of computer-aided drug design.

On one hand, we investigate [structure-based methods](/research/structure-based/) for active site assessment, including [binding site comparison](/research/structure-based/binding-sites/), [pharmacophore elucidation](/research/structure-based/pharmacophore-modelling/) and off-target prediction; pocket-centric [fragment-based design](/projects/kinfraglib/) as well as [deep learning enhanced virtual screening pipelines](/projects/deeplearning-vs/). Besides target-independent approaches, we focus our developments on [kinases](/research/structure-based/kinases/), one of the major classes of therapeutic targets.

On the other hand, we study ligand-based methods, including [machine learning methods for activity and toxicity prediction](/research/machine-learning/) and apply them in translational projects. Special focus is set on integrating novel techniques taking the [applicability and reliability into account](/projects/knowtox/), and the [interpretability of deep learning methods](/projects/cytotox/). Our major goal here is the establishment of alternative _in silico_ methods to determine the risk of compounds and their harmful effects on humans, animals, plants and environment (see [BB3R platform](https://www.bb3r.de/en/index.html)).

Additionally, we continuously work on the integration of the two research areas of structure- and ligand-centered projects, i.e., focusing on [structure-informed machine learning approaches](/projects/kinoml/) applied primarily to [kinases](/research/openkinome/). In this attempt, we are integrating the physical aspects into molecular modelling (e.g. molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations) to better sample the drug target interactions. The [OpenKinome](/research/openkinome/) initiative is an ongoing collaboration with the [lab](http://www.choderalab.org/) of Prof. John Chodera ([Einstein Visiting Fellow](https://www.einsteinfoundation.de/en/people-projects/einstein-bih-visiting-fellows/john-chodera/)).
