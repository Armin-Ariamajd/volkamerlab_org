3D pharmacophore modeling is a powerful tool to encode a ligand's physicochemical properties in space 
(pharmacophore features), which are reported or believed to be important for ligand-target binding.
Such a model can be used for virtual screening for novel ligands matching the pharmacophore features.
Depending on the availablility data for a target under investigation, 
3D pharmacophores can be generated from either 
a set of known ligands (*ligand-based*), 
ligand-macromolecule complexes (*interaction-based*), or 
macromolecules with binding ligands (*target-based*).
Pharmacophores can be built upon static structures from e.g. X-ray experiments (*static pharmacophores*), 
however since ligands and macromolecules are of dynamic nature, 
molecular dynamic simulations have been more and more employed to add structures' dynamic behaviour to 
pharmacophore modeling (*dynamic pharmacophores*).
In our group, we work on the two tools T²F-Pharm and T²F-Flex 
for static and dynamic target-based pharmacophore modeling, respectively.

## Static target-based pharmacophores

##### T²F-PHARM

Pharmacophore models are an accurate and minimal tridimensional abstraction of intermolecular interactions 
between chemical structures, usually derived from a group of molecules or from a ligand-target complex. 
Only a limited amount of solutions exists to model comprehensive pharmacophores using the information 
of a particular target structure without knowledge of any binding ligand. 
In the T²F-Pharm project, we developed an automated and customable tool for truly target-focused pharmacophore modeling. 
Key molecular interaction fields of a macromolecular structure are calculated using the AutoGRID energy functions. 
The most relevant points are selected by a newly developed filtering cascade and clustered to pharmacophore features 
with a density-based algorithm. 
This method represents an extremely valuable instrument for drug design in a situation of scarce ligand information 
available, but also in the case of underexplored therapeutic targets, 
as well as to investigate protein allosteric pockets and protein-protein interactions.
