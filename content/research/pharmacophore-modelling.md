3D pharmacophore modeling is a powerful tool to encode a ligand's physicochemical properties in space 
(pharmacophore features), which are reported or believed to be important for ligand-target binding.
Such a model can be used for virtual screening for novel ligands matching the pharmacophore features.
Depending on the availablility data for a target under investigation, 
3D pharmacophores can be generated from either 
a set of known ligands (*ligand-based*), 
ligand-macromolecule complexes (*interaction-based*), or 
macromolecules with binding ligands (*target-based*).
Pharmacophores can be built upon static structures from e.g. X-ray experiments (*static pharmacophores*), 
however since ligands and macromolecules are of dynamic nature, 
molecular dynamic simulations have been more and more employed to add structures' dynamic behaviour to 
pharmacophore modeling (*dynamic pharmacophores*).
In our group, we work on the two tools T²F-Pharm and T²F-Flex 
for static and dynamic target-based pharmacophore modeling, respectively.
