3D pharmacophore modeling is a powerful tool to encode a ligand's physicochemical properties in space (pharmacophore features), which are supposed to be important for ligand-target binding. Such a model can be used for virtual screening for novel ligands matching the pharmacophore features. Depending on the available data for a target under investigation, 3D pharmacophores can be generated from either a set of known ligands (*ligand-based*), ligand-macromolecule complexes (*structure/interaction-based*), or macromolecules (apo structures) without binding ligands (*target-based*).

Pharmacophores can be built upon static structures from e.g. X-ray experiments (*static pharmacophores*), however since ligands and macromolecules are of dynamic nature, molecular dynamic simulations have been more and more employed to add a structure's dynamic behaviour to pharmacophore modeling (*dynamic pharmacophores*). We work on two tools, *T²F-Pharm* and *T²F-Flex*, for static and dynamic target-based pharmacophore modeling, respectively.
