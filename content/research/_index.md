At the Volkamer Lab, we develop novel methods at the interface between structural bioinformatics and cheminformatics, mostly applied in the context of computer-aided drug design. Here, the individual [projects](/projects/) are grouped into the following research lines. For more information click on the individual topics.

## Research lines

### Structure-based (binding site centric) approaches

* Binding-site comparison
  * Targetome-wide binding site comparison
  * Kinome-wide binding site comparison
* Pharmacophore modelling
  * Static target-based pharmacophores
  * Dynamic target-based pharmacophores
* Kinase-focused
  * Kinase-fragment library
  * `klifs_utils`
* Protein-ligand interaction fingerprints

### Machine learning based methods

* ML-based toxic endpoint prediction
  * KnowTox
  * CP_Tox21
  * Cytotoxicity
* DL-based VS

### OpenKinome
* KinoML(kinopoly?)
* MIAME
* More kinase related work (link to KiSSim and KinFragLib, maybe even to applications)

### Other studies

These projects are usually about compound design, rationalization or molecular optimization. Some recent examples:
