Target deconvolution is a vital initial step in preclinical drug development to determine research focus and strategy. 
In this respect, computational target prediction is used to identify the most probable targets of an orphan ligand or 
the most similar targets to a protein under investigation. 
Applications range from the fundamental analysis of the mode-of-action over polypharmacology or 
adverse effect predictions to drug repositioning.

## Targetome-wide binding site comparison

##### READ-ACROSS THE TARGETOME (ratar)

How to probe and validate a potential target remains one of the key questions in basic research in life sciences. 
In the DFG project "read-across the targetome" (ratar), we will use binding site similarity to extrapolate 
compound information from one target to another. 
This similarity-based knowledge transfer can suggest tool compounds (chemical probes) and 
off-targets for proteins of interest using the ever-growing amount of available target and compound data.

## Kinome-wide binding site comparison

##### KINASE STRUCTURE SIMILARITY (KiSSim)

The KiSSim projects aims to provide a subpocket-focused kinase fingerprint to investigate kinome-wide pocket similarity. 
The KiSSim fingerprint is based on the KLIFS pocket alignment, which defines 85 pocket residues for all kinase structures. 
This enables a residue-by-residue comparison of spatial and physicochemical features 
without the need for a computationally expensive alignment step. 
We aim to use the KiSSim method 
(i) to detect potential promiscuities and off-targets at an early stage of inhibitor design and 
(ii) to conduct structure-informed polypharmacology studies.
