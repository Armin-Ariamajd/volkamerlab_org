T2F-Flex offers pharmacophore modeling from MD simulations of apo structures, i.e. empty binding sites.
The binding site is placed into a grid, where - for each grid point near the binding site surface -
chemical probes are used to check for pharmacophoric features. Resulting features hotspots are clustered and
summarized into a single pharmacophore model. This method allows to generate pharmacophores in the absence of ligand
or interaction information and provides a feature-based description of protein binding sites.
