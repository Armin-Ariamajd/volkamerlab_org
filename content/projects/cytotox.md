Project description (3-6 sentences).

In this project, cytotoxicity prediction, one of the earliest handles in drug discovery, is investigated using a deep learning approach trained on a highly consistent in-house data set of over 34,000 compounds from the FMP.
In addition, to overcome the lack of interpretability in neural networks, a Deep Taylor Decomposition method is investigated to identify substructures that may be responsible for the cytotoxic effects, the so-called toxicophores. This approach could be helpful in drug development to predict the potential toxicity of a compound as well as to generate new insights into the toxic mechanism. Moreover, it could also help to de-risk and optimize compounds.
