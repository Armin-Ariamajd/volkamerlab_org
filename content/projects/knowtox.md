  more: In the notebook it is demonstrated how a conformal predictor is built, applied to make predictions for external
   data, and how to evaluate the internal (crossvalidation) and external predictions.

The project is part of the BMBF-funded BB3R initiative. One major goal of the BB3R initiative is the establishment of 
alternative methods for preclinical drug development and basic research. To assess the toxicity of novel chemical 
entities, regulatory agencies require in-vivo testing for several toxic endpoints. In 2010, roughly 2.9 million 
laboratory animals have been deployed in Germany, with an increase of 6% since 2008. Thus, the establishment of
 alternative methods, and with it the reduction of animal testing, is of utmost importance. Determining the toxicity 
 of compounds is vital to identify their harmful effects on humans, animals, plants and the environment.

Machine learning models should not only be well-performing. It is also important to know if the models can be applied 
to a certain dataset and if (how much) we can trust the predictions. This can be approached with conformal prediction,
a recently promoted method for confidence estimation. A conformal predictor returns, whether enough evidence is given
to reliably assign the query substance to a certain class. The conformal prediction framework is built on top of 
machine learning models, but includes an additional calibration step. Thus, predictions made for a query compound
are compared to those made for the calibration set compounds.

KnowTox is a novel pipeline that combines three different in silico toxicology approaches to allow for confident 
prediction of potentially toxic effects of query compounds, i.e. machine learning models, alerts for toxic 
substructures and computational support for read-across. When applying machine learning models, applicability
and reliability of predictions for new chemicals are of utmost importance. This was approached using conformal
prediction. Several adaptions of the framework were investigated and proposed (i.e. KNN normalisation and 
balancing of proper training set) to improve the model performance. The model set-ups were validated using androgen 
receptor antagonism datasets.

The KnowTox pipeline is available within our group and we are happy to apply it in collaboration projects.
