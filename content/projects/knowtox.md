  more: In the notebook it is demonstrated how a conformal predictor is built, applied to make predictions for external data, and how to evaluate the internal (crossvalidation) and external predictions.

KnowTox is a novel pipeline that combines three different in silico toxicology approaches to allow for confident 
prediction of potentially toxic effects of query compounds, i.e. machine learning models, alerts for toxic 
substructures and computational support for read-across. When applying machine learning models, applicability
and reliability of predictions for new chemicals are of utmost importance. This was approached using conformal
prediction. Several adaptions of the framework were investigated and proposed (i.e. KNN normalisation and 
balancing of proper training set) to improve the model performance. The model set-ups were validated using androgen 
receptor antagonism datasets.

The KnowTox pipeline is available within our group and we are happy to apply it in collaboration projects.
