  more: In the notebook it is demonstrated how a conformal predictor is built, applied to make predictions for external
   data, and how to evaluate the internal (crossvalidation) and external predictions.

KnowTox is a novel pipeline that combines three different in silico toxicology approaches to allow for confident
prediction of potentially toxic effects of query compounds, i.e. machine learning models, alerts for toxic
substructures and computational support for read-across. When applying machine learning models, applicability
and reliability of predictions for new chemicals are of utmost importance. This was approached using conformal
prediction. Several adaptions of the framework were investigated and proposed (i.e. KNN normalisation and
balancing of proper training set) to improve the model performance. The model set-ups were validated using androgen
receptor antagonism datasets.

The KnowTox pipeline is available within our group and we are happy to apply it in collaboration projects.

The project is part of the BMBF-funded BB3R initiative. One major goal of the BB3R initiative is the establishment of
alternative methods for preclinical drug development and basic research. To assess the toxicity of novel chemical
entities, regulatory agencies require in-vivo testing for several toxic endpoints.
