In this collaboration with Bayer and the Chodera Lab, we aim to advance and apply [KinoML](/projects/kinoml/), an open source framework combining structure-informed machine learning with alchemical free energy calculations developed in our group, to address pharmaceutically relevant drug design challenges. Special emphasis is put on the effect of point mutations on binding affinity and how these can be exploited to expand the indications of already approved drugs and to guide molecular design.
