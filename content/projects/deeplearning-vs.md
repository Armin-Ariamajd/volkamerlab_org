DeeplearningVS is a project which aims to study a novel rescoring method based on deep learning (DL) techniques to enhance the accuracy of the docking procedure, and boost the  structure-based virtual screening outcome. For machine learning in general, and even more for DL, an integral asset to success is the availability of a large training data set, as well as a good feature encoding for the problem in hand. In this work, the increasingly large number of available protein-ligand complex data (like PDB structures) will be used and further enriched by a novel idea of artificially created protein-ligand complex analogues. Furthermore, different encoding strategies such as grid as well as protein-ligand fingerprint-based methods will be further explored and combined with novel features to improve model performance. Besides, thoroughly retrospective evaluation of the model quality, the complete docking and rescoring workflow will be implemented to screening for novel Smyd1 inhibitors together with our collaboration partners.
