The KinFragLib project allows to explore and extend the chemical space of kinase inhibitors using
data-driven fragmentation and recombination, built on available structural kinome data from the KLIFS database
for over 2,500 kinase complexes. The computational fragmentation method splits known non-covalent
kinase inhibitors into fragments with respect to their 3D proximity to six predefined subpockets relevant for binding.
The resulting fragment library consists of six subpocket fragment pools with over 7,000 fragments and
offers two main applications:
(i) In-depth analyses of the chemical space of known kinase inhibitors allow to investigate
subpocket characteristics and connections.
(ii) Subpocket-informed recombination of fragments enumerates new combinations of known fragments
in order to generate potential novel inhibitors.
