##### PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Protein kinases play a crucial role in many cell signaling processes, making them one of the most important families 
of drug targets. 
Fragment-based drug design has proven useful as an approach to develop novel kinase inhibitors. 
However, fragment-based methods are usually limited to a knowledge-driven approach of optimizing 
a focused set of fragments. 
Here, we present a data-driven fragmentation and recombination approach instead. 
A novel computational fragmentation method was implemented, 
which splits known kinase inhibitors into fragments with respect to the subpockets that they occupy. 
Thereby, a fragment library with several pools, representing the subpockets, is created. 
This fragment library enables an in-depth analysis of the chemical space of known kinase inhibitors, 
and is used to recombine fragments in order to generate novel potential inhibitors.
