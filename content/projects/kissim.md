##### PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Kinases are important and well studied drug targets for cancer and inflammatory diseases. 
Due to the highly conserved structure of kinases, especially at the ATP binding site, 
the main challenge when developing kinase inhibitors is achieving selectivity, 
which requires a comprehensive understanding of kinase similarity.
In our *kissim* project, we developed a subpocket-focused kinase fingerprint to investigate kinome-wide pocket similarity. 
The *kissim* fingerprint is based on the KLIFS pocket alignment, which defines 85 pocket residues for all kinase structures. 
This enables a residue-by-residue comparison of spatial and physicochemical features 
without the need for a computationally expensive alignment step. 
We aim to use the *kissim* method 
(i) to detect potential promiscuities and off-targets at an early stage of inhibitor design and 
(ii) to conduct structure-informed polypharmacology studies.
