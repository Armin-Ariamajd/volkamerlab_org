Machine learning algorithms, including Conformal Prediction (CP), are only intended to be applied to data where training data and novel data (to predict) are drawn from the same distribution (exchangeability). Unfortunately, this is often not the case.

In this project, we study how CP calibration plots can be used to diagnose deviations from exchangeability.

This is introduced specifically to the field of computational toxicology and applied to the Tox21 datasets. Additionally, an approach to improve applicability of CP models to new data by updating the calibration set with more recent data is investigated.
